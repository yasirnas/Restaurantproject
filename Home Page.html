                <p>In 1953, Luigi’s Pizza Parlor was opened by a team of bookies from Southern Italy. Seeking a front for their illegal gambling, the owners made pizza, pasta and sauces from scratch in the hopes that their back-room card games and gambling business would be overlooked by the Sacramento Police Department. As it turned out, these bookies were better at slinging pie than running numbers, and Luigi’s Pizza Parlor settled successfully into place as the oldest original pizza parlor in Sacramento.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>In 1965, the Brida family of Northern Italy bought Luigi’s and continued the tradition of great pizza. For an impressive 53 years, the Bridas have passed the parlor from generation to generation, handing down secret family recipes, and making Luigi’s the much-loved restaurant it is today.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2019 the traditions of Luigi’s Pizza Parlor were once again passed on. This time to Sacramento-local families with a deep love for pizza and beer. Having grown up eating at Luigi’s we are excited to welcome you back to your neighborhood pizza parlor.</p>
